Introduction to Galaxy Spectroscopy and Redshift Estimation
Understanding galaxy spectra is fundamental in extragalactic astronomy. By analyzing the light emitted or absorbed by galaxies, we can determine their physical properties, chemical composition, and motion relative to us. One of the most crucial measurements from spectra is the redshift (z), which provides insights into the universe's expansion and the distance of galaxies.

What is Spectroscopy?
Spectroscopy is the study of how light interacts with matter. When we observe a galaxy, we see a spectrum—a distribution of light intensity as a function of wavelength. This spectrum contains key emission and absorption lines, which correspond to specific atomic transitions in elements such as hydrogen, oxygen, sodium, and calcium.

Key Spectral Features in Galaxies
Galaxy spectra contain both:

Emission lines – Produced by hot, ionized gas in star-forming regions (e.g., H-alpha, [O III]).
Absorption lines – Formed when cooler gas absorbs specific wavelengths of light from stars (e.g., Ca II H & K, Na I D).
Each element has a characteristic set of spectral lines, which appear at fixed rest-frame wavelengths when measured in a laboratory. However, in galaxies moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe, these lines appear shifted to longer (redder) wavelengths—a phenomenon known as redshift.

Redshift and Cosmic Expansion
Redshift ((z)) is defined as:

𝑧=𝜆obs−𝜆rest𝜆rest
 

where
𝜆obs
 
is the observed wavelength of a spectral line, and
𝜆rest
 
is its rest-frame wavelength. A higher redshift means the galaxy is farther away and moving faster due to cosmic expansion.

Workshop Demonstration: Estimating Redshift for NGC 3310
In this session, we will:

✅ Download the SDSS spectrum.
✅ Identify key spectral lines in the observed data.
✅ Compare them to their rest-frame positions.
✅ Measure the shift of an absorption line (e.g., Ca II K) and calculate the redshift.
✅ Apply this shift to correct the spectrum and compare it with standard spectral features.

By the end of this exercise, you will gain hands-on experience in analyzing galaxy spectra, identifying spectral lines, and estimating redshifts—essential skills for observational astronomy!
