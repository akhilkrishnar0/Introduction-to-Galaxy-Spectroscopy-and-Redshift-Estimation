# **Introduction to Galaxy Spectroscopy and Redshift Estimation**

Understanding galaxy spectra is fundamental in extragalactic astronomy. By analyzing the light emitted or absorbed by galaxies, we can determine their physical properties, chemical composition, and motion relative to us. One of the most crucial measurements from spectra is the **redshift (z)**, which provides insights into the universe's expansion and the distance of galaxies.

## **What is Spectroscopy?**
Spectroscopy is the study of how light interacts with matter. When we observe a galaxy, we see a **spectrum**—a distribution of light intensity as a function of wavelength. This spectrum contains key **emission** and **absorption** lines, which correspond to specific atomic transitions in elements such as hydrogen, oxygen, sodium, and calcium.

## **Key Spectral Features in Galaxies**
Galaxy spectra contain both:

- **Emission lines** – Produced by hot, ionized gas in star-forming regions (e.g., H-alpha, [O III]).  
- **Absorption lines** – Formed when cooler gas absorbs specific wavelengths of light from stars (e.g., Ca II H & K, Na I D).  

Each element has a characteristic set of spectral lines, which appear at fixed **rest-frame wavelengths** when measured in a laboratory. However, in galaxies moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe, these lines appear **shifted to longer (redder) wavelengths**—a phenomenon known as **redshift**.

## **Redshift and Cosmic Expansion**
Redshift (\(z\)) is defined as:

$$ z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}} - \lambda_{\text{rest}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} $$


where $$\lambda_{\text{obs}}$$ is the observed wavelength of a spectral line, 
and $$\lambda_{\text{rest}}$$ is its rest-frame wavelength. 
A higher redshift means the galaxy is farther away and moving faster due to cosmic expansion.


## **Workshop Demonstration: Estimating Redshift for NGC 3310**
In this session, we will:

✅ Download the SDSS spectrum.  
✅ Identify key spectral lines in the observed data.  
✅ Compare them to their rest-frame positions.  
✅ Measure the shift of an absorption line (e.g., Ca II K) and calculate the redshift.  
✅ Apply this shift to correct the spectrum and compare it with standard spectral features.  

By the end of this exercise, you will gain hands-on experience in **analyzing galaxy spectra, identifying spectral lines, and estimating redshifts**—essential skills for observational astronomy!
